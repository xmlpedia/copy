Just download [standalone web page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitaps-com/mnemonic-offline-tool/master/index.html)
and use it offline.

Mnemonic tools for offline usage:


* dice generation mnemonic code 
* javascript ([NIST SP 800-22 randomness tests on the fly](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf)) generation mnemonic code 
* split mnemonic code using threshold secret sharing scheme
* restore mnemonic code from secret shares
* derive XPUB, XPRIV
* derive addresses for BIP44, BIP49, BIP84
* derive addresses for BIP32 custom path
